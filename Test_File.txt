Coveware's ransomware marketplace report has shown that in the first quarter of 2020, the average ransom payment rose by 33 percent on Q4 2019 to $111,605 (USD). The average was driven up by an increase in the targeting of large enterprises. However this remains the minority by volume and the median figure remained almost stable over the same period at $44,021. Sodinokibi, Ryuk and Phobos remained the most common ransomware types and Mambo increased over the quarter. Ryuk in particular focused on larger enterprises.
